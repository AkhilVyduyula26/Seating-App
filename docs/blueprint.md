# **App Name**: SeatAssignAI

## Core Features:

- Automated Seating Allocation: The system automatically allocate seats, considering no two students from the same branch are seated next to each other, using a tool.
- Data Upload and Input: Admin uploads student data (Name, Hall Ticket Number, Branch, Contact Number) and seating capacity via a CSV upload component.
- Seating Chart Visualization: Admin views the complete seating chart with Block, Floor, Classroom, and Bench Number details for each student, with search and filter options.
- Student Login and Information Display: Students log in with their Hall Ticket Number to view their seating details, with a success message upon login.
- Unique Seat Assignment: The system generates Block, Floor, Classroom, and Bench Number details and includes exam date/time on the seating info and WhatsApp alert, enabling WhatsApp API integration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and organization.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#ECEFF1), a muted background to reduce distraction and ensure readability.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FF9800) to highlight key interactive elements like login buttons and important notifications.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif, which provides a clean, modern, objective look suitable for both.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent locations (block, floor, classroom) and seating arrangements.
- Divide the UI into clear sections with dedicated dashboards for Admin and Student roles.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to indicate seating assignments or data updates.
